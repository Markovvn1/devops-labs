## üìù About The Project

The repository contains a simple python web application which shows the server time in Moscow. Time is updated when you refresh the page.

The application is written using the [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) framework. [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) (ASGI web server) is used to run the application. [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is used for the dependency management. In addition, the application can be run inside a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container.

Application is using [Prometheus FastAPI Instrumentator](https://github.com/trallnag/prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator) to collect metrics. All metrics available on `/metrics`.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start (for Linux only)

1. Download the repository and change the current directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Markovvn1/devops-labs.git && cd devops-labs
   ```

2. Switch to lab8 branch and open project's directory:

   ```bash
   git checkout lab8 && cd app_python
   ```

3. Configure virtual environment. Before proceeding, make sure you have installed [build-essential](https://packages.debian.org/en/sid/build-essential) (to be able to use `make` command) and python [venv module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). This command should create the `.venv` folder with python virtual environment.

   ```bash
   make venv
   ```

4. Run the project:

   ```bash
   make up
   ```

5. Open the website `http://localhost:8080/` to view the server time in Moscow.

### :whale: Docker-way to quick start

Before proceeding, make sure you have installed [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

1. Run docker container (support linux/amd64, linux/386, linux/arm64, linux/arm/v7):

   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm -p 8080:80 markovvn1/iu-devops:lab_python
   ```

2. Open the website `http://localhost:8080/` to view the server time in Moscow.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Developing

Configure virtual environment. Make sure a `.venv` folder has been created after this step.

```bash
make venv
# source .venv/bin/activate
```

Run the project in developing mode (with auto reloading):

```bash
make up_dev
```

Run linters, formaters and tests:

```bash
make lint  # check code quality
make format  # beautify code
make test  # run unit and integrated tests
```

Build docker image:

```bash
make build_docker
```
