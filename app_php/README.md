## üìù About The Project

Everyone knows that rabbits multiply very quickly, so it is important to be able to count the number of rabbits quickly. This project provides a web application to help solve this problem. The app will be useful for people who work on a rabbit farm and need to count the number of rabbits on a daily basis.

The app is easy to use. Open the browser and go to the app website (see Quick start). To increase the rabbit counter by 1, click on the picture of the rabbit.

The repository contains a docker container with simple php web application that helps you to count rabbits.  The application is written using the [php](https://www.php.net/) and can be run inside a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container.
