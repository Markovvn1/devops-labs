# Php best practices

* Use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for quick and easy app deployment: guarantee of reproducibility of the project on other computers
* I use 2 linters to ensure quality of my site: [NoVerify](https://vkcom.github.io/noverify/playground/) (for php), [html-linter](https://pypi.org/project/html-linter/) (for html)
* Use [markdownlinter](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) to check Markdown files (exclude rule MD033 - I prefer a pretty README.md to proper one)

I chose PHP because:

* I already have experience with it
* It is simple, fast
